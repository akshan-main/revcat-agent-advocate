Customer.io can be a powerful integration tool for automating targeted messaging based on real-time customer behavior. With Customer.io's flexible automation platform, you can design personalized journeys that adapt to each user's subscription lifecycle.

With our Customer.io integration, you can:

- Create an onboarding flow for users who have subscribed but have not yet engaged with the tutorial or first steps of your product.
- Send a push notification to churned users and [offer them a discount](/subscription-guidance/subscription-offers/ios-subscription-offers).

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in Customer.io, you'll be set to turbocharge your campaigns â¡ï¸

For events that have revenue, such as trial conversions and renewals, RevenueCat will automatically record this amount along with the event in Customer.io. Bear in mind that revenue will always be reported in USD. If it's been made with a different currency, we'll automatically convert it to USD. You can find the currency of the original transaction in the `currency` field of the event.

## Setup

### 1. Set Customer.io User Identity

In order to associate RevenueCat data with a Customer.io Person, the RevenueCat `$customerioId` [Attribute](/customers/customer-attributes) should be set in RevenueCat to the Person's `id`. If this field does not exist, RevenueCat will fallback to using the RevenueCat app user ID as the `id`. If there is no matching Person, it will be created automatically. You can read more about how the association works in Customer.io's [Identifying people](https://docs.customer.io/journeys/identifying-people/#identifiers) documentation.

### 2. Send RevenueCat Events to Customer.io

After you've set up the Purchase SDK and Customer.io SDK to have the same user identity, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'Customer.io' from the Integrations menu

![Integration setup](/docs_images/integrations/setup-integrations.png)

2. Add your Site ID and API key
3. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
4. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.

## Testing the Customer.io integration

### Make a sandbox purchase with a new user

Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete the [sandbox purchase](/test-and-launch/sandbox).

### Check that the Customer.io event delivered successfully

While still on the Customer View, select the purchase event in the [Customer History](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile) page and make sure that the Customer.io integration event exists and was delivered successfully.

![Check that the Customer.io event was delivered](/docs_images/integrations/third-party-integrations/customerio/customerio_event_details.png "Check that the Customer.io event was delivered")

### Check the Customer.io dashboard for the delivered event

Navigate to your Customer.io dashboard > Activity Logs. In the 'Identified' tab, you will see that an event was delivered and a Person was created.

![Check Customer.io Activity Logs](/docs_images/integrations/third-party-integrations/customerio/customerio_activity_logs.png "Check Customer.io Activity Logs")

## Sample Events

Below are sample JSONs that are delivered to Customer.io for events.

*Interactive content is available in the web version of this doc.*

## Subscription Status Attribute

Whenever RevenueCat sends an event to Customer.io, we'll update the `rc_subscription_status` user attribute with any applicable changes, using one of the following values:

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                                |

| promotional         | The customer has access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat [Granted Entitlement](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile#entitlements) |
| expired\_promotional | The customer previously had access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat Granted Entitlement that has since expired.                      |
| paused              | The customer has a paid subscription which has been paused and is set to resume at some future date.                                       |

For customers with multiple active subscriptions, this attribute will represent the status of only the subscription for which the most recent event occurred.

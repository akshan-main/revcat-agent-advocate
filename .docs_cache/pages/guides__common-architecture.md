Integrating RevenueCat with your backend allows you to seamlessly manage subscription purchases and unlock content for users while keeping your existing setup intact. By using RevenueCatâs SDK and webhooks, you can ensure that your backend stays synchronized with user purchases and entitlements, providing a reliable and up-to-date system for managing access to premium content.

### Process Flow

#### 1. App: Paywall Load and Offer Display

Paywall Load: When users open the app, the paywall loads and displays the available subscription offerings in the UI.

User Makes Purchase: Users can choose a subscription plan and proceed with the purchase.

#### 2. RevenueCat SDK: Handling Purchases

Fetch Offerings: The RevenueCat SDK fetches available offerings and displays them to the user.

Process Purchase: The RevenueCat backend validates and processes the purchase details received from the SDK.

Complete Purchase: The SDK finalizes the purchase, and the results are sent to the RevenueCat backend for further processing.

Restore Purchase: The SDK allows you to regain access to entitlements after a transfer happens from one app user ID to another.

#### 3. RevenueCat Backend: Subscription Management

Process Purchase: The RevenueCat backend validates and processes the purchase details received from the SDK.

Unlock Entitlements: Once the purchase is confirmed, RevenueCat unlocks the corresponding entitlements.

Dispatch Webhooks & Events: RevenueCat sends webhooks and events to your backend and any other third-party integrations configured, keeping everything in sync.

Fetch Entitlements: The backend fetches the updated entitlements data.

#### 4. App Backend: Entitlement Synchronization

Receive Webhooks: Your backend receives an initial purchase webhook from RevenueCat, indicating a change in subscription status or new purchase.

Perform Entitlement Sync: The app backend performs an entitlement synchronization by fetching the latest entitlement details from RevenueCat.

Persist Entitlements in DB: Once fetched, the backend persists these entitlements in the database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date access controls.

#### 5. App: Content Unlocking

Query Database for Subscription Status: The app queries your backend database to check the userâs subscription status.

Unlock Content: If the subscription is active, the app unlocks the relevant premium content for the user.

RevenueCatâs Virtual Currency feature is designed to help you track and manage balances of in-app currencies, such as coins, tokens, or minutes granted via purchases. While we donât natively support managing "virtual items" (e.g., consumable items like tickets, skins, or passes that are bought using virtual currency), itâs possible to work around this limitation using a creative implementation of multiple virtual currencies.

This guide walks you through how to implement this pattern.

## Treat Items as Virtual Currencies

If your app has a **small and fixed set of virtual items**, you can represent each item as its own virtual currency.

:::warning 100 virtual currency limit
RevenueCat has a limit of 100 virtual currencies per project that can be configured.
:::

Example scenario:
You want to sell:

- Tickets (cost: 2 coins)
- Passes (cost: 5 coins)

Set up the following virtual currencies in RevenueCat:

- `Coins`: Your primary currency
- `Tickets`: Treated as a currency, but really represents an owned item
- `Passes`: Same as above

## Purchasing a Virtual Item

### 1. Customer Initiates Item Purchase

![](/docs_images/virtual-currency/VIRTUAL_ITEMS_PURCHASE.png)

The customer decides to buy a virtual item (e.g., a ticket) using their coins.

- **Action:** Customer taps "Buy Ticket (2 coins)" in the app.
- **App â Your backend request:**
  ```http
  POST /api/purchase-ticket
  Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "app_user_id": "app_user_id",
    "item": "ticket"
  }
  ```

### 2. Your Backend Contacts RevenueCat API

![](/docs_images/virtual-currency/VIRTUAL_ITEMS_BACKEND_TO_RC.png)

- **API Request to RevenueCat:**
  ```http
  curl --location 'https://api.revenuecat.com/v2/projects/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/customers/<YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID>/virtual_currencies/transactions' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer sk_***************************' \
  --data '{
      "adjustments": {
          "Coins": -2,
          "Tickets": +1
      }
  }'
  ```
- **Validation:** RevenueCat checks that the customer has enough coins and that the transaction is atomic (both succeed or both fail).

### 3. Your App Processes Result

- On success:
  - After any purchases or spends, make sure to invalidate the virtual currencies cache through `invalidateVirtualCurrenciesCache()`
  - Call RevenueCat's `.virtualCurrencies()` SDK method to fetch the updated balance. In this scenario, the updated balance will contain the coin's balance of 8 and ticket's balance of 1
- On failure:
  - This means the customer did not have enough balance to perform the transaction. You should show them a paywall to top-up and/or show an insufficient balance message

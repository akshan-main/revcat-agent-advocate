:::warning Beta Feature
Anomaly Detection Notifications are currently in beta.
:::

With **Anomaly Detection Notifications**, you can receive email alerts about potential revenue anomalies for your projects. Choose between **Custom Threshold Alerts** or **Auto Detection Alerts** to monitor significant changes in revenue. Alerts are sent twice daily, evaluating the last 24 hours of data.

## How can I enable Anomaly Detection Notifications?

1. Click on [**Account**](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/account) from the RevenueCat Dashboard.
2. Open the **Notifications** section where you'll see the **Anomaly Detection Notifications** option.
3. Select the Projects you want to monitor and choose your preferred alert type:

- **Custom Threshold Alerts**: Define a percentage change threshold. For example, set 20% to be notified via email if revenue changes by more than 20% in the last 24 hours.

- **Auto Detection Alerts**: Use our machine learning algorithm, which incorporates time series forecasting with weekly and yearly seasonalities, to automatically detect revenue outliers without needing to set a threshold. Alerts will be sent to your email.

4. Click **Update** to save your changes.

:::info
Currently, you can only set one alert (Custom Threshold or Auto Detection) per project. This limitation is something weâre planning to improve in future updates.
:::

## How does Anomaly Detection work?

- **Custom Threshold Alerts**: Alerts are triggered when the revenue change in the last 24 hours exceeds the percentage threshold you set.
- **Auto Detection Alerts**: Revenue data is analyzed using time series forecasting with weekly and yearly seasonalities to identify unexpected deviations or outliers.
- **Alert Frequency**: Anomaly checks are performed twice daily, and email alerts are sent based on data from the last 24 hours.

| Can I configure multiple alerts (Custom Threshold and Auto Detection) for the same project? | Not at this time. Currently, you can only choose one type of alert per project. However, this is a feature we are planning to enhance in the future.                                                      |
| When are the alerts sent?                                                                   | Alerts are sent twice daily after anomaly detection checks are performed, and notifications are delivered to your registered email address.                                                               |
| How does the machine learning algorithm in Auto Detection work?                             | The algorithm uses time series forecasting to account for weekly and yearly seasonalities, identifying unexpected deviations or outliers in revenue data.                                                 |
| Can I receive notifications for multiple projects?                                          | Yes, you can select multiple projects to monitor for anomalies from the **Notifications** section of your account settings.                                                                               |
| How do I know if an alert was triggered by a false positive?                                | You can review your revenue trends on the RevenueCat Dashboard to validate alerts. If you encounter consistent false positives, reach out through [Support](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/support). |

## Beta Limitations

Anomaly Detection is currently in beta, and there are a few limitations to be aware of:

- Fixed check frequency: Anomalies are evaluated twice daily, meaning sudden changes between checks may not trigger an immediate alert.
- False positives and false negatives:
  - A false positive means you might receive an alert for a revenue change that isn't actually an anomaly (e.g., expected fluctuations due to promotions or seasonality).
  - A false negative means a real anomaly might not be detected, especially if it's subtle or follows an unusual but valid pattern.
  - We are currently tweaking the alert thresholds to improve accuracy and reduce unnecessary alerts.

We are continuously improving the model to reduce these cases, but itâs always a good idea to cross-check alerts with your own revenue trends.

If you notice any issues or have feedback, please reach out to [RevenueCat Support](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/support).

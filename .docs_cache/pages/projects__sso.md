# Set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for RevenueCat

This guide walks you through enabling and configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) for your RevenueCat account.

:::info
SSO is currently available for customers on an **Enterprise plan**.
:::

## How SSO works in RevenueCat

- Once SSO is enabled, **users with your organizationâs email domain will be required to sign in to RevenueCat through SSO**.
- SSO is enforced at the **account/organization** level for the configured email domain.

## What youâll need before you start

### Roles

- Someone on your team who can **manage your identity provider** (for example, configuring SAML/OIDC and SCIM).

### Identity provider requirements

Your identity provider must support:

- **SAML or OpenID Connect (OIDC)** for authentication, such as Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, AWS Cognito, etc.
- **SCIM provisioning** for directory sync

## Step-by-step: Enable SSO

### 1) Request SSO enablement

Contact your **RevenueCat account manager** to request SSO enablement for your organization.

### 2) Configure Your Identity Provider

Once SSO has been enabled for your organization, navigate to your [**Account > Security > SSO**](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/security/sso) settings and click **Manage SSO Connection**.

This will open the WorkOS Admin Portal where you can configure your SAML or OIDC identity provider settings.

Configure your identity provider details and test the connection in the WorkOS portal. Once complete, you'll be redirected back to the RevenueCat Dashboard.

### 3) Set Up Directory Synchronization

Configure SCIM provisioning with your identity provider to synchronize user directories and groups.

### 4) Create groups in your identity provider

In your identity provider, create (or select) groups that correspond to the RevenueCat roles you want to grant (for example, Admin, Developer, Support, or View Only).

If a user belongs to multiple groups, RevenueCat will grant the **highest** role.

### 5) Map SSO groups to RevenueCat roles

In the RevenueCat dashboard:

1. Go to **Project Settings â Collaborators**

![Collaborators](/docs_images/projects/sso-collaborators.png)

:::caution
Enabling SSO **removes all existing project collaborators** and replaces them with SSO group mappings. Make sure the **project owner** completes setup in RevenueCat **and** in your identity provider before activating SSO.
:::

2. Add an **SSO Group**
3. Select the **RevenueCat role** that group should receive

![SSO group to role mapping interface](/docs_images/projects/sso-configure.png)

Changes may take a few minutes to sync.

**Role precedence (highest wins):**

1. Admin
2. Developer
3. Growth
4. Support
5. View Only

> Mapping SSO groups updates project collaborators and may affect currently signed-in users.

### 6) Activate SSO

Once you've completed the SSO connection setup, directory synchronization, and role mappings, navigate to [**Account > Security > SSO**](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/security/sso) and click **Activate SSO**.

:::warning Members of the domain will only be able to use SSO
When the SSO of your organization is active, users with the domain of your organization will be required to sign in using SSO.
:::

After activation, users with your configured email domain will be required to sign in using SSO.

## Managing Your SSO Connection

After initial setup, you can manage your SSO connection settings at any time by clicking **Manage SSO Connection** from [**Account > Security > SSO**](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/security/sso).

This allows you to:

- Update identity provider configuration
- Modify SAML or OIDC settings
- Test your SSO connection
- View connection status

Changes made in the WorkOS Admin Portal are saved automatically and may take a few moments to reflect in the RevenueCat Dashboard.

## Managing Your Directory Sync

After initial setup, you can manage your directory synchronization settings at any time by clicking **Manage Directory Sync** from [**Account > Security > SSO**](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/security/sso).

This allows you to:

- Update SCIM provisioning configuration
- Modify directory sync settings
- View synchronization status
- Test directory connection

Changes made in the WorkOS Admin Portal are saved automatically and may take a few moments to reflect in the RevenueCat Dashboard.

## Validation checklist

After activating SSO, we recommend verifying the following:

- At least one admin can sign in via SSO
- Users receive the correct project access based on group mappings
- Group and role changes sync successfully (allow a few minutes)

## FAQ

### What happens if a user is in multiple SSO groups?

The user is granted the **highest** applicable role based on role precedence.

### Do I need to configure SSO group mappings for each project?

Yes. Collaborator access is managed per project, so role mappings must be set up individually for each project.

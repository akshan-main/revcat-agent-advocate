The processes for setting up Google Play service credentials and real-time developer notifications to communicate with RevenueCat on your behalf can be complex, and span across multiple consoles and dashboards. Use this handy checklist to go through and make sure you hit each step in your configuration.

Note that while our [credentials guide](/service-credentials/creating-play-service-credentials) and our [developer notifications guide](/platform-resources/server-notifications/google-server-notifications) will move back and forth between the Google Play Console, the Google Cloud Console, and the RevenueCat dashboard, we've combined the steps into categories for ease of use.

## Google Play Service Credentials Checklist

### In Google Cloud:

I have created, either during this process or previously, a Google Cloud
project dedicated to this app.

I have enabled both Google Play Android Developer API and(Interactive content is available in the web version of this doc.)
Google Play Developer Reporting API.

I have created a service account under the above Cloud project.

I have given the service account the roles of Pub/Sub Editor(Interactive content is available in the web version of this doc.)
(or Admin) and Monitoring Viewer.

I have created and downloaded a JSON public key under the service account I
created.

### In Google Play:

I invited the created service account as a user in(Interactive content is available in the web version of this doc.)
Users and Permissions, and the status is "Active".

Under the service account user's Account Permissions, I have
added:

View app information and download bulk reports (read-only)
View financial data, orders, and cancellation survey response
Manage orders and subscriptions

After confirming permissions, I selected Apply, then(Interactive content is available in the web version of this doc.)
Save Changes.

I have uploaded my signed APK or Android App Bundle.

I have completed all the steps to approve the release.

The app is in a Closed or Open testing track and I've added a tester.

My Subscriptions are in an Active state.

### In RevenueCat:

I added the previously downloaded JSON key file to the RevenueCat dashboard
and clicked Save Changes.

I've waited at least 36 hours.

## Google Real-Time Developer Notifications Checklist

I have waited to ensure that my service credentials are set up correctly and
working as expected.

### In Google Cloud:

I have enabled the Pub/Sub API for the same project in which
I previously created service credentials.

### In RevenueCat:

I have chosen either an existing Pub/Sub Topic ID or created a new one.

I have clicked Connect to Google.

I have copied the topic ID that generated after connecting.

### In Google Play:

Under Monetize, in Monetization Setup, I
pasted the topic ID.

I have saved changes and did not see any errors.

I clicked Send Test Notification and confirmed it was
received in the RevenueCat dashboard.

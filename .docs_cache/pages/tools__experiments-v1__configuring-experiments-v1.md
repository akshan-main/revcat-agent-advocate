Before setting up an experiment, make sure you've created the Offerings you want to test. This may include:

- Creating new Products on the stores
- Setting Offering Metadata, and/or
- Creating a RevenueCat Paywall

You should also [test the Offerings you've chosen](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/offering-override) on any platform your app supports.

## Setting up a new experiment

First, navigate to your Project. Then, click on **Experiments** in the project sidebar.

You have two options for creating a new experiment:

### Creating a new experiment from scratch

Select **+ New** to create a new experiment from scratch.

:::info Set up offering(s) for your experiment

If you've not setup multiple offerings yet, you'll be prompted to do so now, since you'll need at least 2 available offerings to run an experiment.

For **App Store** apps, we recommend setting up new products to test as a new **Subscription Group** in App Store Connect so that customers who are offered those products through Experiments will see only that same set of products to select from their subscription settings.
:::

### Duplicating an existing experiment

You can also create a new experiment by duplicating the configuration of a previous experiment. This is useful when you want to run a similar test with slight modifications or test the same configuration on a different audience.

To duplicate an experiment:

1. Find the experiment you want to duplicate in your experiments list
2. Click on the **context menu** (three dots) next to the experiment
3. Select **Duplicate** from the menu
4. A new experiment will be created with the same configuration as the original
5. You can then modify any settings as needed before starting the duplicated experiment

:::tip When to use duplicate
Duplicating is particularly useful when you want to:

- Re-run a successful experiment on a different audience or time period
- Test slight variations of a previous experiment configuration
- Quickly set up similar experiments without manually configuring all settings again
  :::

Regardless of which method you choose, you'll need to configure the experiment settings as described below.

## Fields

To create your experiment, you must first enter:

- **Experiment name**: A descriptive name for your test
- **Experiment type** (optional): Choose from preset types (Introductory offer, Free trial offer, Paywall design, Price point, Subscription duration, Subscription ordering, or Other) to get relevant default metric suggestions
- **Notes** (optional): Add markdown-formatted notes to document your hypothesis and track insights
- **Variant A (Control)**: The Offering(s) for your control group (baseline)
- **Variant B (Treatment)**: The Offering(s) for your first treatment group

### Adding more variants for multivariate testing

You can add up to 2 additional treatment variants:

- **Variant C (Treatment)**: Optional second treatment variant
- **Variant D (Treatment)**: Optional third treatment variant

Multivariate experiments allow you to test multiple variations against your control simultaneously, helping you identify the best-performing option more efficiently than running sequential A/B tests.

## Using Placements in Experiments

Placements allow you to define a unique Offering to serve at each paywall location in your app, so that you can do things like:

1. Show a unique paywall design at the end of onboarding vs. in settings
2. Offer unique prices on the paywall triggered when a customer attempts to access a gated feature vs. the paywall that's triggered after a certain number of app opens

If you've not setup Placements yet, [start here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/targeting/placements).

With Experiments, you can create A/B tests that serve unique Offerings at each Placement to your Control group and Treatment group.

![Adding Placements to Experiments](/docs_images/experiments/v1/experiments-placements.png)

With Placements, your customers will be served an array of Offerings depending on the paywall location they visit, and with Experiments you can A/B test that experience by changing any element of that array.

:::tip Isolating the impact of each paywall change
If you're looking to isolate the impact of changing just one paywall location, then modify the Offering being served at that Placement in the Treatment group and keep all other Placements the same. But be sure to specify your desired Offering for each Placement that your app uses, even if the Offering for a given Placement should be the same on both the Control and Treatment.
:::

## Audience customization

Then, you can optionally customize the audience who will be enrolled through your experiment through **Customize enrollment criteria** and **New customers to enroll**. Please note: only new customers will be enrolled in Experiments. Existing customers will not be enrolled.

**Customize enrollment criteria**

Select from any of the available dimensions to filter which new customers are enrolled in your experiment.

| Dimension              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Country                | Which countries are eligible to have their new customers enrolled in the experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| App                    | Which of your RevenueCat apps the experiment will be made available to.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| App version            | Which app version(s) of the specified apps must a new customer be on to be enrolled in the experiment.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| RevenueCat SDK version | Which RevenueCat SDK version(s) of the specified SDK flavor must a new customer be on to be enrolled in the experiment. *(NOTE: This is most likely to be used in conjunction with features like RevenueCat Paywalls which are only available in certain SDK versions)* |
| Platform | Which platform(s) that were first used by the customer are eligible for the experiment (e.g. iOS, watchOS, etc). |

**New customers to enroll**

You can modify the % of new customers to enroll (minimum 10%) based on how much of your audience you want to expose to the test. Keep in mind that the enrolled new customers will be split evenly between all variants. For example, an A/B test (2 variants) that enrolls 10% of new customers would yield 5% in the Control group and 5% in the Treatment group. A 4-variant multivariate test enrolling 20% of new customers would yield 5% in each variant.

Once done, select **CREATE EXPERIMENT** to complete the process.

## Starting an experiment

When viewing a new experiment, you can start, edit, or delete the experiment.

- **Start**: Starts the experiment. Customer enrollment and data collection begins immediately, but results will take up to 24 hours to begin populating. After that, results refresh periodically - check the **Last updated** timestamp on the Results page to see when data was last refreshed.
- **Edit**: Change the name, enrollment criteria, or Offerings in an experiment before it's been started. After it's been started, only the percent of new customers to enroll can be edited.
- **Delete**: Deletes the experiment.

:::warning Sandbox

Test users will be placed into the experiment Offering variants, but sandbox purchases won't be applied to your experiment.

If you want to test your paywall to make sure it can handle displaying the Offerings in your experiment, you can use the [Offering Override](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile#current-offering) feature to choose a specific Offering to display to a user.
:::

## Pausing an experiment

Once an experiment is running, you can pause it to stop enrolling new customers while continuing to collect data from existing participants. This is useful when you want to:

- Evaluate the long-term impact of experiment exposure on already enrolled customers
- Stop exposing new customers to test variants while maintaining consistent behavior for existing participants
- Temporarily halt enrollment while analyzing preliminary results

When paused:

- New customers will no longer be enrolled in the experiment
- Customers already enrolled will continue to see their assigned variant
- Data collection continues for all enrolled customers
- Results will continue to update with data from existing participants for up to 400 days

## Resuming a paused experiment

You can resume a paused experiment to start enrolling new customers again by clicking the **Resume** button.

Before resuming an experiment, we'll check if it conflicts with any currently active experiments. If resuming would cause audience overlap, you'll see an error message and will need to either pause or stop the conflicting active experiment(s) to avoid overlap.

## Stopping an experiment

Once an experiment is running or paused, you can permanently stop it by clicking the **Stop** button. This is appropriate when you want to:

- End the experiment after a clear winner has emerged and you're ready to implement the results
- Stop a poorly performing experiment to prevent further negative impact
- Clear the way for a new experiment with an overlapping audience
- Conclude an experiment that has run its full planned duration

:::warning Stopping vs. Pausing
**Pausing** is reversible - you can resume the experiment later. **Stopping** is permanent - the experiment cannot be restarted. Consider pausing instead of stopping if you might want to resume enrollment in the future.
:::

When an experiment is stopped:

- New customers will no longer be enrolled
- Customers who were enrolled will begin receiving the Default Offering on their next paywall view
- Results will continue to refresh for 400 days after the experiment has ended

## Rolling out a winner

Once you've identified a winning variant from your experiment results, you can roll it out to all your users. RevenueCat provides several options for applying your experiment results:

### Rollout options

When you mark a variant as the winner, you can choose from these rollout strategies:

1. **Set as default offering**: The winning variant's offering becomes your project's default offering, served to all customers who aren't targeted by specific rules
2. **Create targeting rule**: Create a new targeting rule that serves the winning offering to a specific audience (e.g., specific countries, platforms, or custom attributes)
3. **Mark winner only**: Record which variant won without immediately changing your offering configuration - useful for tracking insights and planning future rollouts

### How to roll out a winner

1. Navigate to your experiment's results page
2. Review the performance data to identify the winning variant
3. Click **Review and mark as winner**
4. Select your preferred rollout option
5. Confirm the rollout

| Winner recommendation | Rollout options |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Winner recommendation](/docs_images/experiments/v1/winner-recommendation.png) | ![Winner rollout modal](/docs_images/experiments/v1/winner-rollout-modal.png) |

:::tip Gradual rollouts
If you want to roll out your winning variant gradually rather than all at once, choose the "Create targeting rule" option and set the rule to apply to a percentage of your audience. You can increase the percentage over time as you gain confidence.
:::

:::info Experiment data after rollout
After rolling out a winner, your experiment results remain available for 400 days, allowing you to track long-term performance and learn from your test.
:::

## Running multiple tests simultaneously

You can use Experiments to run multiple test simultaneously as long as:

1. All audiences being enrolled in running tests are mutually exclusive (e.g. either two tests have exactly the same audience, or have fully unique audiences)
2. A given audience has no more than 100% of its new customers enrolled in experiments

If a test that you've created does not meet the above criteria, we'll alert you to that in the Dashboard and you'll be prevented from starting the test, as seen below.

![Experiments conflict](/docs_images/experiments/v1/experiments-conflict.png)

### Examples of valid tests to run simultaneously

**Scenario #1 -- Multiple tests on unique audiences**

1. Test A is running against 100% of new customers for your App Store app
2. Test B, targeting 100% of new customers for your Play Store app, can also be run since its targeted audience is mutually exclusive with Test A, and no more than 100% of each audience's new customers are being enrolled in running experiments

**Scenario #2 -- Multiple tests on identical audiences**

1. Test A is running against 20% of new customers in Brazil
2. Test B, targeting 40% of new customers in Brazil, can also be run since its targeted audience is identical with Test A, and no more than 100% of that audience is being enrolled in running experiments

### Examples of invalid tests to run simultaneously

**Scenario #3 -- Multiple tests on partially overlapping audiences**

1. Test A is running against 100% of new customers for your App Store app
2. Test B, targeting 100% of new customers in Brazil, **cannot** be run because there is partial overlap between the audience of Test A and the audience of Test B (new customers using your App Store app in Brazil).
   1. To run Test B, either Test A will need to be paused, or the audience of Test B will need to be modified to exclude new customers from the App Store app.

**Scenario #4 -- Multiple tests on >100% of an identical audience**

1. Test A is running against 20% of new customers in Brazil
2. Test B, targeting 100% of new customers in Brazil, **cannot** be run because the targeted audience would have > 100% of new customers enrolled in experiments, which cannot be possible.
   1. To run Test B, either Test A will need to be paused, or the enrollment percentage of Test B OR Test A will need to be modified so that the total does not exceed 100%.

:::info Editing running experiments

When an experiment is running, only the percent of new customers to enroll can be edited. This is because editing the audience being targeted would change the nature of the test, rendering its results invalid.

## FAQs

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Can I edit the Offerings in a started experiment? | Editing an Offering for an active experiment would make the results unusable. Be sure to check before starting your experiment that your chosen Offerings render correctly in your app(s). If you need to make a change to your Offerings, stop the experiment and create a new one with the updated Offerings. |
| Can I run multiple experiments simultaneously? | Yes, as long as they meet the criteria described above. |
| Can I run an experiment targeting different app versions for each app in my project? | No, at this time we don't support setting up an experiment in this way. However, you can certainly create unique experiments for each app, and target them by app version to achieve the same result in independent test. |
| Can I add multiple Treatment groups to a single test? | Yes, experiments support up to 4 variants total: 1 Control (Variant A) and up to 3 Treatment variants (B, C, D). This allows you to test multiple variations simultaneously in a single multivariate experiment. |
| Can I edit the enrollment criteria of a started experiment? | Before an experiment has been started, all aspects of enrollment criteria can be edited. However, once an experiment has been started, only new customers to enroll can be edited; since editing the audience that an experiment is exposed to would alter the nature of the test. |
| What's the difference between pausing and stopping an experiment? | Pausing temporarily stops new customer enrollment while existing participants continue to see their assigned variant. The experiment can be resumed later. Stopping permanently ends the experiment: new customers won't be enrolled and existing participants will see the Default Offering on their next paywall view. A stopped experiment cannot be restarted. Both paused and stopped experiments continue collecting data for up to 400 days. |
| Can I pause an experiment multiple times? | Yes, you can pause and resume an experiment as many times as needed. This allows you to control enrollment based on your testing needs and timeline. |
| Will pausing affect the data collection for already enrolled customers? | No, pausing only affects new enrollments. Customers already in the experiment will continue to see their assigned variant and their behavior will continue to be tracked in the experiment results for up to 400 days. |
| Can I edit a paused experiment? | When an experiment is paused, you cannot edit its configuration. You can only resume it to continue enrollment or stop it permanently. To make changes, you would need to stop the experiment and create a new one. |
| How do paused experiments affect the audience overlap checks? | Paused experiments don't count toward audience overlap since they're not actively enrolling new customers. However, when you try to resume a paused experiment, we'll check if it conflicts with any currently active experiments and prevent resuming if there's an overlap. |
| Can I restart an experiment after it's been stopped? | After you choose to stop an experiment, new customers will no longer be enrolled in it, and it cannot be restarted. However, if you need to temporarily halt new enrollments with the option to resume later, consider using the pause feature instead. Paused experiments can be resumed at any time. If you've already stopped an experiment and want to continue testing, create a new experiment and choose the same Offerings as the stopped experiment. You can use the duplicate feature to quickly recreate the same experiment configuration. *(NOTE: Results for stopped experiments will continue to refresh for 400 days after the experiment has ended)* |
| Can I duplicate an experiment? | Yes, you can duplicate any existing experiment from the experiments list using the context menu. This creates a new experiment with the same configuration as the original, which you can then modify as needed before starting. This is useful for running similar tests or follow-up experiments. |
| What happens to customers that were enrolled in an experiment after it's been stopped? | New customers will no longer be enrolled in an experiment after it's been stopped, and customers who were already enrolled in the experiment will begin receiving the Default Offering if they reach a paywall again. Since we continually refresh results for 400 days after an experiment has been ended, you may see renewals from these customers in your results, since they were enrolled as part of the test while it was running; but new subscriptions started by these customers after the experiment ended and one-time purchases made after the experiment ended will not be included in the results. |
| What happens after I pick a winner? | After analyzing your results, you can roll out the winning variant by: (1) Setting the winning variant's offering as your default offering, (2) Creating a new targeting rule to serve the winning offering to specific audiences, or (3) Simply marking a winner without immediate rollout for your records. You'll choose the rollout approach when you declare the winner. |
| How many variants should I use in my experiment? | Start with 2 variants (A/B test) for most cases. Use 3-4 variants (multivariate) when you have multiple distinct hypotheses to test simultaneously. Keep in mind that more variants require more customers to reach statistical significance, so tests take longer. |
| What experiment type should I choose? | Choose the preset that best matches what you're testing. Presets provide relevant default metrics: "Price point" suggests revenue metrics, "Free trial offer" suggests trial conversion metrics, etc. You can always customize metrics after selecting a type. |

RevenueCat Funnels allow you to build customizable, hosted web onboarding experiences that can be designed remotely and shipped by non-developers.

Funnels are multi-step web experiences hosted by RevenueCat that combine the flexibility of Paywalls with configurable flows to design your own custom web acquisition funnel. Each funnel consists of multiple **steps** that can be connected to create linear or branching user journeys.

With Funnels, you can:

- **Design custom onboarding flows** that match your brand and aesthetics
- **Understand your customers better** through survey questions
- **Create branching logic** where survey responses, URL parameters, and other dimensions determine the next step in the flow
- **Connect attribution data** via UTM parameters for branching logic & filtering analytics
- **Offer web purchasing** to convert your customers to purchasers right on the web
- **Remotely configure** your entire funnel experience without code changes
- **Ship updates instantly** without any technical expertise

## Why use web funnels?

Web funnels provide several key advantages for apps investing in user acquisition:

- **Improved attribution**: Automatically capture and surface UTM parameters and other tracking data from ad campaigns, making it easy to measure the effectiveness of your marketing spend and understand which campaigns drive the highest LTV customers.
- **Lower friction**: Web-based onboarding experiences eliminate the need for users to install an app before making a purchase decision. This reduces friction in the conversion process and can improve conversion rates compared to app-only flows.
- **Rapid iteration**: Since funnels are remotely configured, you can test different messaging, layouts, and flow logic without requiring app updates or developer involvement. This enables faster experimentation and optimization of your conversion funnel.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| Funnel | A multi-step web experience consisting of connected screens and checkout pages |
| Step | An individual page in your funnel. Steps can be screens (fully customizable pages) or checkout (hosted purchase flow) |
| Screen | A customizable page built using RevenueCat's Paywall UI builder. Screens can contain text, images, buttons, input fields, and other components, just like a Paywall |
| Checkout | A dedicated purchase step that handles the payment flow using RevenueCat Web Billing |
| Trigger | An action on a step (like button press or form submission) that determines the next step in the flow |
| Branch | Conditional logic that determines the next step in the flow based on conditions you configure on a trigger |
| Initial step | The first step that users see when they access your funnel |
| Template | Pre-built funnel configurations that you can use as starting points |

## Prerequisites

Before creating your first funnel, you need to set up RevenueCat Web Billing. Funnels use Web Billing to process payments through checkout steps, so this configuration is required.

To configure payments for Funnels, you'll need:

- **Stripe account**: Connect your Stripe account to RevenueCat to process payments
- **Web Billing app**: Create a Web Billing app configuration with your app details, default currency, and branding
- **Products**: Configure at least one Web Billing product that customers can purchase
- **Offerings**: Create an offering that groups your Web Billing products (checkout steps use offering settings)
- **Apple Pay / Google Pay domain registration**: Register your funnels checkout domain in Stripe. See [Configuring Apple Pay & Google Pay](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/web/web-billing/payment-methods#configuring-apple-pay--google-pay).

For detailed setup instructions, see [Configuring Payments](/tools/funnels/configuring-payments).

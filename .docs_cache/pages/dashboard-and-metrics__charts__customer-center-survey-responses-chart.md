## How to use Customer Center Survey Responses in your business

You might use this chart to track the total number of survey responses occurring over time, or to understand the mix of answers that your customers most commonly select. It may be especially useful to track changes in the portion of cancellations coming from each reason over time (tip: use the 100% Stacked column chart type for this), to understand if there are specific moments where the mix shifts that might be attributable to audience or product changes.

## Calculation

For each period we count the volume of survey responses that occurred in that period, broken down by the response option selected. Those possible response options are configured in the Customer Center settings. By default, the following response options are configured for the cancellation management option:

1. Too expensive
2. Don't use the app
3. Bought by mistake

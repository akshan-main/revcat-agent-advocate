![Customer Center Change Plans Configuration](/docs_images/customer-center/customer-center-change-plans.png)

Change Plans allows iOS customers to switch between different subscription products directly within the Customer Center. This feature provides a seamless experience for users who want to upgrade, downgrade, or modify their current subscription.

This setup enables RevenueCat to automatically present the appropriate product change options based on a user's current subscription, providing a streamlined experience for product modifications.

The SDK will automatically display available product options based on the user's active subscription and the products configured in your subscription group.

You can configure which products will be offered as a product change, instead of showing all the products within the subscription group. Rather than showing all available products, you can choose a specific subset of subscriptions to offer as change options for each product.

**This feature works for products within the same subscription group.**

## Configuration

After setting up your subscription group in App Store Connect, you need to configure which specific products should be available for changes in the Customer Center settings.

For each subscription group, you can select a subset of products to offer as change options rather than displaying all products in the group. You must select at least 2 subscriptions per group to enable product changes.

**Important**: If your subscription group has 2 or fewer products, the configuration is automatic and all available products in the group will be shown as change options. Manual configuration is only available for subscription groups with 3 or more products.

In the Customer Center Configuration, when selecting the **Change Plans** path, you can specify exactly which products should be presented as change options for each subscription group.

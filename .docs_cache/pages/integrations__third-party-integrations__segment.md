Segment can be a useful integration tool for seeing all events and revenue that occur for your app even if itâs not active for a period of time. You can use Segment to collect data on customer events to create a single view customer portfolio using an API.

With our Segment integration, you can:

- Create an onboarding flow for users who have subscribed but have not yet engaged with the tutorial or first steps of your product.
- Send personalized messages to users who have free trials that are about to expire.

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in Segment, you'll be set to turbocharge your user engagement â¡ï¸

For events that have revenue, such as trial conversions and renewals, RevenueCat will automatically record this amount along with the event in Segment.

## Setup

### 1. Set Segment User Identity

If you're using the Segment SDK, you can set the User ID to match the RevenueCat App User Id. This way, events sent from the Segment SDK and events sent from RevenueCat can be synced to the same user.

Use the `.identify()` method on the Segment SDK to set the same App User Id that is set in RevenueCat.

*Interactive content is available in the web version of this doc.*

### 2. Generate a Segment Write Key

In Segment, add a HTTP API as a source and copy the Write Key.

![](/docs_images/integrations/third-party-integrations/segment/segment-write-key.png)

### 3. Send RevenueCat events to Segment

After you've set up the *Purchases SDK* and Segment SDK to have the same user identity, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'Segment' from the Integrations menu

![Integration setup](/docs_images/integrations/setup-integrations.png)

2. Choose your Segment region.
3. Add your **Segment Write Key** from step 2.
4. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names.
5. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.
6. Select whether you want RevenueCat to send sandbox events into Segment or not. You can check the `environment` key in the `context` property of the event to determine if it was triggered in a sandbox or production environment.

## Sample Events

Below are sample JSONs that are delivered to Segment for each event type.

## Subscription Status Attribute

Whenever RevenueCat sends an event to Segment, we'll update the `rc_subscription_status` user attribute with any applicable changes, using one of the following values:

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| cancelled           | The customer has a paid subscription which is set to expire at their next renewal date.                                                    |
| grace\_period        | The customer has a paid subscription which has entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                                 |

| cancelled\_trial     | The customer is in a trial period which is set to expire at the end of their trial period.                                                 |
| grace\_period\_trial  | The customer was in a trial period and has now entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                                 |
| expired             | The customer's subscription has expired.                                                                                                   |
| promotional         | The customer has access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat [Granted Entitlement](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile#entitlements) |
| expired\_promotional | The customer previously had access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat Granted Entitlement that has since expired.                      |
| paused              | The customer has a paid subscription which has been paused and is set to resume at some future date.                                       |

For customers with multiple active subscriptions, this attribute will represent the status of only the subscription for which the most recent event occurred.

Please note that since this attribute is set and updated when events are delivered, subscribers with events prior to our release of this attribute (during November 2023) will not have this attribute set until/unless a future event (renewal, cancellation, etc) occurs.

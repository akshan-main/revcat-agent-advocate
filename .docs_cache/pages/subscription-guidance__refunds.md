Refunds are handled differently on each platform. It's recommended to set up [Platform Server Notifications](/platform-resources/server-notifications) for the best performance.

## Platforms

### Apple

**Subscriptions**

â RevenueCat will automatically detect when a refund has been issued by Apple, but Apple does not allow developers to issue refunds on behalf of customers

If a customer requests a refund, you can direct them to the Apple support page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084

**Non-subscriptions**

ð§ RevenueCat requires [Platform Server Notifications](/platform-resources/server-notifications) to be enabled in order to detect when a non-subscription refund has been issued by Apple. Apple does not allow developers to issue refunds on behalf of customers.

If a customer requests a refund, you can direct them to the Apple support page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084

If you configure an [In-App Purchase Key](/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/in-app-purchase-key-configuration) for your app in RevenueCat, Consumable refunds will be detected.

**Handling Refund Requests**

RevenueCat can help influence Apple's refund decisions by automatically sending additional data about your customer's purchase and your preferred resolution when a refund request is submitted.

For detailed information on configuring this feature, see our [Handling Refund Requests](/platform-resources/apple-platform-resources/handling-refund-requests) documentation.

### Google Play

**Subscriptions**

â Active Google Play subscriptions may be refunded directly through the RevenueCat dashboard. Click on the "..." menu on the subscription in the "Entitlements" card of the customer profile and then select "Refund". [Documentation](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile#entitlements#refunding-and-cancelling-purchases) for reference.

Refunds can also be granted programmatically through the RevenueCat [REST API](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference#revoke-a-google-subscription). This will immediately revoke access to the Google subscription and issue a refund for the last purchase.

If a refund is granted by Google or initiated through the Google Play console, it **may take up to 24 hours** to be detected by RevenueCat. Refunds due to no acknowledgement of purchases are not detected automatically. You also must refund and revoke in order for RevenueCat to detect this, only refunding will not be detected. See Google's documentation [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2741495?hl=en#zippy=%2Crefund-subscriptions-including-refund-and-revoke) on this.

**Non-subscriptions**

â Google Play non-subscriptions can be refunded directly through the RevenueCat dashboard or REST API (see refunding Google Play Subscriptions for more info on how to do this).

If a non-subscription refund is granted by Google or initiated through the Google Play console, it **may take up to 24 hours** to be detected by RevenueCat. Refunds due to no acknowledgement of purchases are not detected automatically.

### Stripe

â RevenueCat will automatically detect when a refund has been issued through Stripe. Note that you have the option in Stripe to refund, or refund and revoke access. See Stripe's docs for more info.

### Amazon Appstore

â Amazon does not allow developers to issue refunds on behalf of users.

If a user has a valid reason for a pro-rated refund, they should contact Amazon customer service through the Contact Us link at [amazon.com](https://amazon.com).

Refunds granted through Amazon customer service **will not** be detected as a refund in RevenueCat and the subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period (or indefinitely, for a non-subscription purchase).

## RevenueCat Dashboard

**Google Play** and **Web Billing** purchases can be refunded directly through the RevenueCat dashboard. Granting a refund will immediately expire the subscription and remove any entitlement access. By refunding directly through RevenueCat you can ensure that refunds are accounted for immediately in all charts and integrations.

Apple doesnât allow developers to grant refunds themselves, only through Apple customer support. However, Apple refunds are tracked with RevenueCat and accounted for in all charts and integrations.

## Troubleshooting

### Apple

If you are seeing delays or non-existent non-subscription refunds, make sure that [Platform Server Notifications](/platform-resources/server-notifications) are enabled.

If you are are seeing delays or non-existent consumable refunds, make sure that the [In-App Purchase Key](/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/in-app-purchase-key-configuration) is configured.

### Google Play

If the option to refund is missing from the RevenueCat dashboard, it might be that the subscription is no longer active. Please check the Google Play Console for the order details to confirm this, see Google's documentation [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2741495?hl=en).

If you refunded via the Google Play Console or it was granted by Google, it **may take up to 24 hours** to be detected by RevenueCat. If a refund does not revoke access or the refund is due to no acknowledgement of purchases, then RevenueCat will not pick up on it. You would need to refund and revoke in order for RevenueCat to detect this, see Google's documentation [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2741495?hl=en#zippy=%2Crefund-subscriptions-including-refund-and-revoke).

### Stripe

If you are not seeing refunds from Stripe in RevenueCat, please make sure to have Stripe Server Notifications setup, see [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/platform-resources/server-notifications/stripe-server-notifications). Refunds granted in Stripe after the billing cycle has ended will not be picked up by RevenueCat as the transactions have closed.

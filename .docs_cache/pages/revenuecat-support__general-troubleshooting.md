This guide covers common issues and their solutions.

## General Issues

### Products or Offerings can't be fetched, or Offerings are empty?

**Video:** Watch the video content in the hosted documentation.

*Interactive content is available in the web version of this doc.*

If you can't fetch products, or your offerings are empty, this is nearly always a configuration issue. Our [troubleshooting guide](/offerings/troubleshooting-offerings) covers the most common issues and how to fix them.

### Customer can't access their entitlements?

This can happen for multiple reasons, but the most common reasons for this are the following:

1. The user's identifier changed (via re-installation, created a new account, etc.). This is very common, and should be an expected part of your app's flow. This can happen automatically at times, like after a re-install of your app.
2. The user's subscription purchases expired (in this case, they should re-purchase).

If a user has active purchases that are no longer synced to their user ID or they have lost access, they need to **[restore purchases](/getting-started/restoring-purchases)**. **You should always have a restore purchases button in your app** - typically located in your paywall or in-app settings page to make it easy for your users to find the option.

Restoring purchases will re-sync the user's purchase with the currently identified user ID and re-unlock any entitlements that have been lost due to a changed user ID. If this does not work, it might have to do with you're identifying users or how you are checking for entitlements. We recommend checking the respective docs linked below.

- [Identifying users](/customers/user-ids)
- [Checking subscription status](/customers/customer-info)

### A user's purchases were mistakenly transferred.

If a user's purchases were transferred, it means that a different user ID *claimed* the transactions or purchases that another user in RevenueCat already owned. When we detect this, we perform a *transfer* so that the user can continue accessing purchases on the device they are currently logged into.

While this may seem unexpected at times, this is **extremely common**, and is a valid case for apps with subscriptions. Since the transactions are actually associated with the **underlying store account**, when a user claims a receipt that is already owned by another user ID it means that:

1. The user is logged into the underlying store account, indicating ownership of those purchases.
2. The user is attempting to restore those purchases from a different app user ID than the one that already owns the purchases.

We recommend also looking more into your transfer settings as this can chang the behavior in your app when a transfer is made. More information on this can be found [here](/getting-started/restoring-purchases#transferring-purchases-seen-on-multiple-app-user-ids).

### I accidentally logged in all of my app users with the same app user ID.

A simple way to fix this issue can be found below:

1. Release an app update that removes the hard-coded app user ID and for users who had that app user ID, either:
   1. call logOut
   2. set a different app user ID
2. Wait until most of your users get the update.
3. Delete the hard-coded app user ID from the [dashboard](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile#delete-customer) or the [API](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/api-v1#tag/customers/operation/delete-subscriber).
4. Users who were reset/reidentified will need to restore purchases in order to re-gain their entitlements and re-link their subscription with their current app user ID.
   :::info
   You can delete the hard-coded user at any time that you see it pop up in the dashboard (This might happen since some users may be slower to update the app).

### Can I reset customer attributes?

While you can't directly reset customer attributes, you can delete your current attribute by passing null or an empty string as the key value. Once you do this you will have to call restorePurchases or syncPurchases to trigger an update to the cache. Individual attributes can also be cleared for a specific user in their customer view. Once you do this, you will be able to set these attributes to whatever they need to be set to effectively resetting them.

### Help, I am having issues with the SDK.

We have gone ahead and created a document to troubleshoot SDK problems which we recommend checking out [here](/test-and-launch/debugging/troubleshooting-the-sdks)!

### What countries are supported?

Since RevenueCat works as a wrapper for purchases made by the respective store, we will support purchases from countries that each of the respective stores support.

See [here](/platform-resources/developer-store-payments) for a list of supported countries.

### Why does my app keep getting rejected?

If your app is being rejected from the respective store it can be for many different reasons. We have a useful document [here](/test-and-launch/app-store-rejections) that goes over common reasons for rejection and how to help get your app approved!

### Seeing crashes like `NoCoreLibraryDesugaringException` or `NoClassDefFoundError: com.android.billingclient.api.zzce` in your Android app?

If you're seeing a crash similar to:

```
com.revenuecat.purchases.NoCoreLibraryDesugaringException: Error building BillingFlowParams which is required to perform purchases in the Play store. This is due to an issue in Google's Billing Client library.
	at com.revenuecat.purchases.google.BillingWrapper.buildSubscriptionPurchaseParams(BillingWrapper.kt:959)
```

or

```
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.android.billingclient.api.zzce
	at com.android.billingclient.api.BillingFlowParams$Builder.build(com.android.billingclient:billing@@7.1.1:3)
```

This issue was introduced by Google in the Billing client library in version 7.1.+. It has been reported to Google [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/377466571) and [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/404645683).

The Play Billing Library started using certain Java 8 types, which not all devices can handle. Concretely this issue may happen in specific older Android models.

Until Google fixes this, the current workaround is to enable Core Library Desugaring in your Android app. To do so, you can follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring).

Please let us know if you are still having issues!

## Service credentials issues

Service credentials issues can be tricky and can occur for multiple reasons but will stop you from making purchases successfully. Below is a list of things to check for your credentials in each store.

### Google Play Service credentials Troubleshooting.

Having trouble with Google Play credentials? Check out our troubleshooting guide [here](/service-credentials/creating-play-service-credentials/google-play-checklists) to identify and fix any credential issues.

### App Store Connect API Key.

Make sure to verify that your key ID and Issuer ID are set correctly in correlation with the file that you uploaded.

## Event Issues

### I see an event in RevenueCat, but it wasn't sent to webhooks or my own integration!

Missing events are often a configuration issue. Most third-party integrations that we support require additional configuration before events will be sent; if that configuration hasn't been completed, events won't be dispatched to the third-party provider.

For example, many integrations require a [Attribute](/customers/customer-attributes) to be set on each Customer before events can be dispatched. Ensure that this value (typically from the third-party SDK) is set on a user before contacting support.

## Metrics and Data troubleshooting

### Revenue data in RevenueCat doesn't match the real revenue data for individual transactions.

Revenue and pricing data in RevenueCat uses a **best-effort** approach. Some stores don't allow developers to see individual prices for transactions, so RevenueCat infers transaction prices based on the price of the product when it was originally purchased.

If you **change prices** of your products in App Store Connect or Google Play, revenue data in RevenueCat will be off by a larger margin. For this reason, we almost always recommend [creating a new product instead](/subscription-guidance/price-changes).

In truth, the only **real** metric of earnings is the actual payout amounts that each payment processor (the stores) deposits into your account. You should use revenue metrics in RevenueCat's dashboard to track trends, but for accounting purposes we recommend using the actual store payout reports.

### Metrics that I'm seeing in RevenueCat don't match App Store Connect, Google Play, etc.

RevenueCat doesn't pull data from App Store or Google Play reports directly, so it's very likely the data you see in RevenueCat won't align 1:1 with those stores. This is expected behavior. Additionally, RevenueCat definitions don't always align with store definitions. For example, Google Play considers an 'active subscriber' to include free trials, whereas RevenueCat does not.

Furthermore, RevenueCat metrics (active subscriptions, active trials, etc.) are generated based on *the synced receipts we have for your users*. If those receipts/transactions aren't synced to RevenueCat, they **won't** be included in Charts or other RevenueCat metrics.

If your app sold in-app purchases before implementing the RevenueCat SDK, it's very likely these metrics won't align until every single one of your previous users updates their app to a version with the RevenueCat SDK, and has their transactions synced.

The RevenueCat MCP server supports natural language interactions. Here are common examples:

## Basic Project Information

```
Show me my project details
```

```
List all my apps
```

```
What products do I have in my iOS app?
```

## Creating Resources

```
Create a new iOS app called "Premium Photo Editor" with bundle ID com.company.photoeditor
```

```
Create a monthly subscription product called "Premium Monthly" for my iOS app
```

```
Create an entitlement called "premium_features" with display name "Premium Features"
```

## Managing Relationships

```
Attach the premium monthly product to the premium features entitlement
```

```
Create a new offering called "main_offering" and add packages for monthly and annual subscriptions
```

```
Show me which products are attached to the premium features entitlement
```

## Configuration Management

```
Get the App Store configuration for my iOS app
```

```
Show me all the public API keys for my app
```

```
List all packages in my main offering
```

## Batch Operations

You can perform multiple operations in sequence:

```
Create a new iOS app called "Premium App", then create a monthly subscription product for it, and finally create an entitlement called "premium_access" and attach the product to it
```

## Configuration Queries

Get comprehensive information about your setup:

```
Show me the complete configuration for my main offering including all packages and their attached products
```

## Cross-Platform Management

Manage products across multiple platforms:

```
Create the same product "Premium Monthly" for both my iOS and Android apps
```

## Chat Interaction Tips

- **Be specific**: Include IDs, names, or other identifiers in your requests
- **Use proper terminology**: Use RevenueCat terminology (entitlements, offerings, packages)
- **Check relationships**: Verify product-entitlement relationships after making changes
- **Incremental changes**: Make small, incremental changes rather than large bulk operations

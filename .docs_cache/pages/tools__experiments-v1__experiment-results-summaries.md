## What will be included in my Experiment Results Summaries?

We'll send you an email for each experiment you've had running in the last week in the Projects that you've subscribed to receive these summaries for. It will include the latest results for the experiment, focused on the following key metrics.

For multivariate experiments (3-4 variants), the summary includes performance for all variants compared to the control.

| Metric                    | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial conversion rate   | The percent of customers who purchased any product.                                                                                                                                                |
| Trial conversion rate     | The percent of completed trials that converted to paying subscriptions.                                                                                                                            |
| Conversion to paying      | The percent of customers who made at least one payment on any product.                                                                                                                             |
| Realized LTV (revenue)    | The total revenue that's been generated so far (realized).                                                                                                                                         |
| Realized LTV per customer | The total revenue that's been generated so far (realized), divided by the number of customers. This should frequently be your primary success metric for determining which variant performed best. |

All metrics are reported separately for the Control variant, each Treatment variant, and the relative difference between each treatment and control.

| Are the provided results for just the last week, or for the full test period? | Each email will provided the latest results for the full test period (since it was first started).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| When will the summary be emailed to me?                                       | Performance Summaries are delivered every Monday at 14:00 UTC ([convert to your timezone](https://mytime.io/14:00/UTC)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| What do the red and green colors for the change column indicate?              | When the Treatment is performing worse than the Control for a given metric, it will be colored red; and when the Treatment is performing better than the Control for a given metric it will be colored green.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Why are some metrics empty with just a `-`?                                   | The hyphen indicates an empty data point, which may occur for reasons like: there are 0 trials completed (so trial conversion can not be calculated), or there are 0 enrolled customers (so initial conversion can not be calculated).

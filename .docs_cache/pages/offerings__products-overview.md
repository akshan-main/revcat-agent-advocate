Products are the individual SKUs that users actually purchase from your app. You can create products in two ways:

- **Test Store products** - Create directly in RevenueCat for testing (no store setup required)
- **Real store products** - Products from Apple, Google, Stripe, etc. that process real payments

RevenueCat Offerings are a way to organize and display products to users. You can read more about Offerings [here](/offerings/overview).

## Test Store Products

Create Test Store products directly in RevenueCat for development and testingâno app store setup required.

To create a Test Store product:

1. Go to **Products** in the **Product catalog** section
2. Click **+ New product**
3. Select **Test Store** as the store
4. Enter a product identifier and configure pricing
5. Click **Save**

:::tip
Use Test Store during development. When ready for production, create real store products. See [Sandbox Testing](/test-and-launch/sandbox).
:::

## Real Store Products

For production, set up products in the real stores (Apple, Google, Stripe, etc.). This is where you configure price, duration, and free trials:

- **[iOS / App Store Connect ](/getting-started/entitlements/ios-products)**
- **[Android / Google Play Console ](/getting-started/entitlements/android-products)**
- **[Android / Amazon Appstore ](/getting-started/entitlements/amazon-product-setup)**
- **[Stripe ](/getting-started/entitlements/stripe-products)**
- **[Paddle ](/getting-started/entitlements/paddle-products)**

### Free trials, promotional offers, and other product configuration

RevenueCat supports free trials, promotional offers, and other product configuration options.

You can read more about these product configuration options [here](/subscription-guidance/subscription-offers).

## Import Products to RevenueCat

After setting up products in the real stores, import them into RevenueCat to create a 1-to-1 mapping.

:::info Automatic Tracking
If a user purchases a product that has not been set up in RevenueCat, the transaction will still be tracked in RevenueCat, and the product will be automatically created in RevenueCat.
:::

### Automatically Import Products (recommended)

After connecting your project to a store, RevenueCat supports automatically importing products from the store.

Navigate to the **Products** tab in the settings for your project in the RevenueCat dashboard, and click the **+ New** button, then choose **Import Products**. RevenueCat will display a list of products that are available to import.

:::info
Currently Google's [one-time products](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16430488) must be [backwards compatible](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/entitlements/google-subscriptions-and-backwards-compatibility#product-backwards-compatibility) to be automatically imported. Otherwise they must be manually imported, see below for how to do so.
:::

### Manually Import Products

Navigate to the **Products** tab in the **Product catalog** section of your project in the RevenueCat dashboard. To add a new product, click theÂ **+ New product**Â button and enter the product identifier **exactly as it appears in the store**, as well as the store that the product belongs to.

These product identifiers are the link between RevenueCat, and Apple, Google, Stripe, or Amazon.

When adding products manually for Google Play apps, you will need to add both the subscription ID and the base plan ID, which you can find in Google Play Console as per the following screenshot:

## Product Display Names

To make it easier to identify your products in RevenueCat, you can optionally set a display name for them by:

1. Navigating to a product's configuration page
2. Clicking **Edit**
3. Entering your desired display name
4. Clicking **Save**

:::info
Product display names must be unique within an app. It's a good practice to include the product duration in the display name to avoid name overlaps, for example: 'My Pro Subscription Monthly', 'My Pro Subscription Yearly' etc".

## Next steps

After adding products (Test Store or real store), organize them with Entitlements and Offerings.

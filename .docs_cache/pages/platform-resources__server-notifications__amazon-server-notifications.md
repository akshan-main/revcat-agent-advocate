RevenueCat does not require server notifications from Amazon Appstore, however doing so can speed up webhook and integration delivery times and reduce lag time for [Charts](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts).

:::warning Receipt must exist in RevenueCat
Amazon Appstore Real-time Notifications only work if the receipt exists in RevenueCat when the event is dispatched from Amazon Appstore. If the receipt doesn't exist, the notification will be ignored.

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to your **Amazon app settings** in the RevenueCat dashboard by selecting your app from **Project Settings > Apps**.
2. Expand the **Amazon Real-time Notifications settings** section and copy the endpoint provided under **Amazon Real-time Notifications URL**.

3. Go to the [Amazon Appstore Console](https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/console/apps/list.html) and select your app.

4. Click **App Services** in the left sidebar and under **Real-time Notifications**, expand **Add an Endpoint**.

6. In a few seconds, a label should appear saying **Verified**, confirming that the endpoint was added successfully.

7. In the RevenueCat dashboard, you should see a **Last received at** timestamp for the endpoint too.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the **Verified** label in the Amazon Appstore Console, confirm that you copied the correct URL from the RevenueCat dashboard and click **resend** to try again.

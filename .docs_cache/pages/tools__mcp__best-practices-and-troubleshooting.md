## Best Practices

### API Key Management

- **Use dedicated keys**: Create separate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
- **Principle of least privilege**: Use read-only keys when write access isn't needed
- **Regular rotation**: Periodically rotate your API keys for security

### Naming Conventions

- **Package identifiers**: Follow RevenueCat conventions:
  - `$rc_monthly` for monthly subscriptions
  - `$rc_annual` for annual subscriptions
  - `$rc_three_month`, `$rc_six_month` for other durations
  - `$rc_lifetime` for lifetime purchases
  - `$rc_custom_*` for custom packages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### OAuth Issues

If you're using OAuth to authenticate with the RevenueCat MCP, you may encounter the following issues:

**Unknown MCP Client**

**Symptoms**: OAuth flow fails with an error indicating the client is not recognized
**Cause**: RevenueCat uses a simplified public client registration flow and does not allow automatic client additions. Your MCP client may not be registered with our OAuth server.
**Solution**: Contact [RevenueCat support](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/support) with your client details so we can allowlist your MCP client.

**Outdated Redirect URIs**

**Symptoms**: OAuth flow fails during the redirect step, or you receive an error about invalid redirect URI
**Cause**: MCP clients occasionally update their redirect URIs, and our OAuth server configuration may not yet reflect these changes.
**Solution**: Contact [RevenueCat support](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/support) with the details of your MCP client and the expected redirect URI so we can update our configuration.

#### API Key Issues

**Symptoms**: Authentication errors or "unauthorized" responses
**Solution**:

1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check key permissions (read vs write)
3. Ensure the key belongs to the correct project
4. Update your Authorization header with the correct API key

### Debug Information

For troubleshooting:

1. Test with simple commands like "Show me my project details"
2. Ensure API key has proper permissions in RevenueCat dashboard
3. Check your AI assistant's MCP connection logs

## Security Considerations

- **Use environment-specific keys**: Don't use production keys in development
- **Regular key rotation**: Change API keys periodically
- **Team access**: Use separate keys for each team member when possible
- **Monitor usage**: Regularly review API key usage in your RevenueCat dashboard
- **Secure storage**: Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control

## Error Handling

The MCP server provides detailed error responses including:

- Authentication errors for missing or invalid tokens
- API errors with full RevenueCat API response details
- Validation errors for invalid parameters

All errors are returned in a consistent format with `isError: true` and descriptive error messages.
